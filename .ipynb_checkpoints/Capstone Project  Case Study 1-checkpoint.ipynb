    "##### Background context on the case study:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n",
    "##### Characters and teams:\n",
    "\n",
    "● Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaignand initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and\n",
    "reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy\n",

    "4. How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?\n",
